Team members installed camera libraries for CMUcam5 pixy, our robotâ€™s planned camera. 
Then, team members checked the compatibility of the camera with colour sensing. 
Next, the team worked on developing an outline of the camera mount, while ensuring compatibility with the main robot. 
Following this, the team implemented new source files to header files and made progress on rail design to hold modular components within the robot.
